# Milestones — Solar System 3D orbit map

## Milestone 0 — Repo integration scaffold (navigation + route)
- Added `tools/solar-system/` with `index.html`, `main.js`, `style.css` (placeholder canvas + status overlay).
- Linked from `tools/index.html` as “Solar System”.

How to test:
- Open `index.html` (homepage) → click “Tools” → click “Solar System”.
- Confirm the Solar System page loads and shows a dark canvas placeholder with a small overlay panel.
- Confirm there are no console errors.
